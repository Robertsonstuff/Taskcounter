# Taskcounter
Simple Gui for keeping track of your work day. This gui counts 5 different tasks throughout my day to track how productive I am. This can be used for any line of work, for myself,  being in IT support, the following is how I measure a productive day: long phone calls, interruptions, tickets closed, tickets created and emails sent. This is at it's early stages but still practical for use now.
